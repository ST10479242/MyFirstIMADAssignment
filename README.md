## Meal Suggestion App
this app makes my good friend Hera's life easier by sparring her the time to decide what to cook based on the meal time.
I customized my app to her prefrences.

## Features
  - The user can get a meal suggestion based on the time of day.
  - The user enters the time of day then out comes a suggestion.

  - If the input is valid the meal suggestion will be displayed.
  - The user can make use of the reset button to clear the text.
